The following CSS rule unintentionally targets more elements than intended due to a lack of specificity:

```css
.container p {
  color: blue;
}
```

If other elements within the `.container` also have the `p` tag, this will impact them as well. For example, if there's a `<p>` within a `<div>` inside the `.container`, this CSS will change its color to blue.
